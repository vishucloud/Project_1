/* POINTS TO REMEMBER
'continue' statement causes flow of control to be transferred directly to the conditional
 expression that controls the loop.

It skips to the end of the innermost loop's body and and stop processing
the remainder of the code, basically skipping the remainder of this iteration of the loop.
